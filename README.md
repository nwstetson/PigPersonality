# 🐖 Thank you for viewing my project!

🗒 All the data I used for the Pig Personality Project is located in the Code tab.

📊 My data analysis file is Analyses.qmd

📝 See Data_Collection_Materials for the pig personality survey I created, as well as the ethogram I used and the HanDBase files needed to replicate the project.

🐽 I have also posted some bonus pig pictures and videos

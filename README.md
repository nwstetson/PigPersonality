# PigPersonality

Thank you for viewing my project!

All the data I used for the Pig Personality Project is located in the Code tab.

My data analysis file is Analyses.qmd

See Data_Collection_Materials for the pig personality survey I created, as well as the ethogram I used and the HanDBase files needed to replicate the project.

I have also posted my full thesis, plus some bonus pig pictures and videos 🐖
